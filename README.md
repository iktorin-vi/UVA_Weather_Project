# Analytics
### The main goal of this project is to find comfort coefficients that help to calculate an individual's comfort level based on both external meteorological parameters (temperature, wind speed, humidity, UVA, AOD) and personal anthropometric data (age, gender, BMI derived from height and weight).
The analysis was successfully completed using a regression model with the following outcomes:
-  Dependencies Identified: External and personal factors influencing the comfort index were quantified.
-  Coefficients Extracted: Model coefficients were obtained to measure each factorâ€™s impact.
-  JSON Configuration Created: All parameters were structured into a JSON file.
### Installation
#### Create virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv comfort_env
comfort_env\Scripts\activate 
#### Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
